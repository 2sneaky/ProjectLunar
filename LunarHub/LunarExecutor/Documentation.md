# LunarExecutor - API Documentation
### This is the official LunarExecutor API documentation.
##### The executor uses `lunar` as its API base, similar to Synapse X. Example: `lunar.function()`

## Utility

You can send a message in the Roblox chat with the `lunar.chat` function.
```lua
lunar.chat("This message was sent from LunarExecutor's API!")
```
